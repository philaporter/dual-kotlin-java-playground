### Kotlin playground

I've finally realized that Kotlin is better than Java at basically everything, so I guess it's time to learn how to Kotlin.

### Requirements
```
gradle
Java 8 (I'm using AdoptOpenJDK and Hotspot)
```

### Getting started
```shell script
gradle clean build
java -jar build/libs/kotlin-playground-1.0.0.jar
```
